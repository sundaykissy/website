    <p>I am a PhD Candidate with the Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University. I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees from Usmanu Danfodiyo University and the University of Ilorin, Nigeria, respectively.</p>  

    <p>My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Virtual Reality, and Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on designing, developing, and evaluating immersive training systems. Specifically, my work investigates how VR can be used to improve skill acquisition in sports such as table tennis, where I have explored performance improvement, training strategies, coaching support, and methodological frameworks for evaluation. My studies contribute to understanding how AI-driven feedback, adaptive training protocols, and exergame design can enhance learning, motivation, and long-term engagement.</p>  

    <p>I have published peer-reviewed articles in leading international conferences and journals, and my research has been recognized within the VR and exergaming research communities. I have collaborated with interdisciplinary teams of researchers and industry partners, contributed as a reviewer for international venues, and co-organized academic activities.</p>  

    <p>Beyond academia, I have experience across multiple areas of Computer Science, including software engineering, web development, data science, and applied machine learning. I have also held teaching and mentorship roles, guiding students in advanced web development, VR technologies, and experimental research design.</p>  

    <p>Feel free to reach out to me to discuss potential collaborations in VR training, exergame evaluation, HCI, and AI-enhanced learning technologies :)</p>
